Cartographer is a Python library which implements the Mapper 
algorithm [#mapper_first]_ for data visualization and exploration.
The design goal of this particular implementation is to be flexible,
extendible and fully scikit-learn_ compatible. 

Features
========

Installation
============

The Mapper algorithm of the library only requires a modern version
of scikit-learn (and its dependencies numpy and scipy). Nevertheless,
to run the examples, also a Jupyter Notebook installation with a Python
Kernel and the seaborn visualization library are required.
Both Python 2 and Python 3 are supported and tested for the time being, while
the suggestion is using the later.



Documentation
=============

The documentation of this software library, together with more information
the Mapper algorithm and some examples of its use can be found
at http://pablodecm.com/cartographer.
